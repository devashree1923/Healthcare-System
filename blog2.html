  <h2 class="text-center">Why People Excercise...</h2>
  <p class="copy">With the broader fitness narrative emphasizing weight loss, unrealistic expectations, and physical appearance, it can be challenging to dig deep and define your “why” when it comes to exercise.

The good news? Fitness IS about so much more than losing a few pounds, getting shredded, or trying to emulate a “perfectly” toned body.

Fitness is about what you can gain. It’s about measuring success by how you feel, not by the scale. It’s about improving physical, mental, and emotional health.

It’s about moving in a way that brings you joy so you’ll keep going for years. And it’s about meeting you where you’re at on your fitness journey.

To help kick-start your journey toward finding the “why,” we interviewed 12 trainers, yoga instructors, parents, and others about WHY they exercise, how they fit it in, what inspires them to keep going, and a favorite motivational phrase they share with others.</p>

          <p>I exercise to honor life. I have lost loved ones that [have inspired] me to keep myself and others LIVING and MOVING!

  I believe we do not OWN our bodies; rather, we borrow them for this human experience. I want to keep this vehicle clean, tuned up, and running on great fuel. That way, I can keep enjoying the open road with my loved ones!</p>

          <p>I practice yoga so that the daily stresses and difficulties have a way to release from my muscles, and to reverse my reaction to stress. I practice yoga to train my mind not to be so habitual. I practice yoga to keep my body supple as I age. I practice yoga to develop intimacy with my body and to get to know who I am at a deeper level.</p>

          <p>I exercise because it allows me to be a better version of myself physically and mentally. It positively enriches all aspects of my life, both personally and professionally.
            Through exercise, I’ve developed success traits such as work ethic, discipline, confidence, and accomplishment. It also gives me what feels like unlimited energy and the ability to do daily tasks and recreational activities almost effortlessly.</p>

      <td><p class="copy">Exercise and physical activity can be enjoyable. They give you a chance to unwind, enjoy the outdoors or simply engage in activities that make you happy. Physical activity can also help you connect with family or friends in a fun social setting.

So take a dance class, hit the hiking trails or join a soccer team. Find a physical activity you enjoy, and just do it. Bored? Try something new, or do something with friends or family.
